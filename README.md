# Go-video-streaming-server-hls

<h2>Description </h2>
HLS is a streaming protocol that allows large media files to be served as many smaller text files that are broken up into roughly  10-second increments. By breaking them up, the userâ€™s client-side application only needs to buffer ~10 seconds in advance. This saves the user a lot of potential bandwidth and allows songs or videos to start playback almost immediately.

## Repositories :-
